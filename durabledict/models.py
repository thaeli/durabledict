from durabledict.base import DurableDict


class ModelDict(DurableDict):

    """
    Dictionary-style access to a model. Populates a cache and a local in-memory
    to avoid multiple hits to the database.

        # Given ``Model`` that has a primary key (``pk``) column that can be
        # strings:

        mydict = ModelDict(Model.manager, value_col='foo')
        mydict['test']
        >>> 'bar' #doctest: +SKIP

    The first positional argument to ``ModelDict`` is ``manager``, which is an
    instance of a Manager which ``ModelDict`` uses to read and write to your
    database.  Any object that conforms to the interface can work, but the
    expectation is that ``manager`` is a Django.model manager.

    The constructor also takes a 2nd positional ``cache`` argument, which is an
    object that responds to two methods, add and incr.  The cache object is used
    to manage the value for last_updated.  ``add`` is called on initialize to
    create the key if it does not exist with the default value, and ``incr`` is
    done to atomically update the last_updated value.

    By default, ``ModelDict`` will use the ``pk`` column of your model as the
    "key" for the dictionary.  If you want to use another key besides the
    ``Model``s ``pk``, you may specify that in the constructor with ``key_col``
    kwarg.  For instance, if your ``Model`` has a column called ``id``, you can
    index into that column by passing ``key_col='id'`` in to the contructor:

        mydict = ModelDict(Model, key_col='id', value_col='foo')
        mydict['test']
        >>> 'bar' #doctest: +SKIP

    Additionally, the default column used to store the values is the ``value``
    column.  If you'd like to use another column pass the ``value_col`` kwarg to
    the constructor.

    By default, ``ModelDict`` instances will return the decoded value present in
    the ``value_col``.  If, instead, you would like to return the entire model
    instance, you can instead pass ``True`` to the ``return_instances`` kwarg.

            # However, there is a race condition. It is entirely possible that

            # have an out of date value for ``self.last_synced`` - such as if
