    Dictionary backed by Zookeeper.  Functions just as you would expect a normal
    dictiony to function, except the values in the dictionary are persisted and
    loaed from Zookeper located at the spcified ``path`` in the constructor.

    Due to Zookeeper's watchers, this dictionary has the nice property that the
    called to its ``last_updated`` method (to check if the storage has been
    updated since the dict was last synced) simply returns a cached value -- it
    does not query Zookeeper or anything like that, so it's basically free.
    This means that you can run this dictionary with ``autosync=True`` and it
    will still be reasonably performant.

    Dictionary keys in a ``ZookeeperDict`` are stored at inividual nodes in the
    zookeeper heirarchy, with the value of the node being the value of that key.
    Each node for each dict key is a child of the "root" node, whose path is
    specified with the ``path`` argument in the constructor.

    NOTE: unlike ``RedisDict`` or ``Durabledict``, which are backed by hightly
    consistent backend storages, ``ZookeeperDict`` is backed with Zookeeper,
    which has looser consistency guarantees.

    Please see this page in the Zookeeper docs for details:

    http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkGuarantees

    The basic things to keep in mind are:

        Sequential Consistency:
        Updates from a client will be applied in the order that they were sent.

        Atomicity:
        Updates either succeed or fail -- there are no partial results.

        Single System Image:
        A client will see the same view of the service regardless of the server
        that it connects to.

        Reliability:
        Once an update has been applied, it will persist from that time forward
        until a client overwrites the update. This guarantee has two
        corollaries:

            If a client gets a successful return code, the update will have been
            applied. On some failures (communication errors, timeouts, etc) the
            client will not know if the update has applied or not. We take steps
            to minimize the failures, but the only guarantee is only present
            with successful return codes. (This is called the monotonicity
            condition in Paxos.)

            Any updates that are seen by the client, through a read request or
            successful update, will never be rolled back when recovering from
            server failures.

        Timeliness:
        The clients view of the system is guaranteed to be up-to-date within a
        certain time bound. (On the order of tens of seconds.) Either system
        changes will be seen by a client within this bound, or the client will
        detect a service outage.

    The cliff notes version of this is that a client's view of the world will
    always be consistent (you can read your own writes), but updates from other
    clients can take time to propogate to other clients.
